Each ravenous foe in your path will be cunning, vicious and always on the hunt â€“ eager to sink their teeth into you, or even each other. As a small, soft slugcat you must rely on stealth and wit rather than force: learn the ecosystem and turn their strengths to your advantage. Maybe then you can surviveâ€¦ Rain World!",
