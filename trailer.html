                    Every day, millions of players worldwide enter battle as one of 
                    over a hundred Dota heroes. And no matter if it's their 10th hour 
                    of play or 1,000th, there's always something new to discover. 
                    With regular updates that ensure a constant evolution of gameplay,

                    ensure everyone is playing on an even field, the core content of 
                    the game—like the vast pool of heroes—is available to all players. 
                    Fans can collect cosmetics for heroes and fun add-ons for the world 
                    they inhabit, but everything you need to play is already included 
                    before you join your first match.<br><br>
                    <strong>Bring your friends and party up.</strong>

                    but it's never too late to join. <br>Learn the ropes playing co-op vs. bots.
