                    <h2>About This Game</h2>
                    <strong>The most-played game on Steam.</strong><br>
                    Every day, millions of players worldwide enter battle as one of 
                    over a hundred Dota heroes. And no matter if it's their 10th hour 
                    of play or 1,000th, there's always something new to discover. 
                    With regular updates that ensure a constant evolution of gameplay, 
                    features, and heroes, Dota 2 has truly taken on a life of its own.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>One Battlefield. Infinite Possibilities.</strong><br>
                    When it comes to diversity of heroes, abilities, and powerful items, 
                    Dota boasts an endless array—no two games are the same. Any hero can 
                    fill multiple roles, and there's an abundance of items to help meet 
                    the needs of each game. Dota doesn't provide limitations on how to play, 
                    it empowers you to express your own style.<br><br>
                    <strong>All heroes are free.</strong><br>
                    Competitive balance is Dota's crown jewel, and to 
                    ensure everyone is playing on an even field, the core content of 
                    the game—like the vast pool of heroes—is available to all players. 
                    Fans can collect cosmetics for heroes and fun add-ons for the world 
                    they inhabit, but everything you need to play is already included 
                    before you join your first match.<br><br>
                    <strong>Bring your friends and party up.</strong>
                    <br>Dota is deep, and constantly evolving, 
                    but it's never too late to join. <br>Learn the ropes playing co-op vs. bots. 
                    Sharpen your skills in the hero demo mode. Jump into the behavior- 
                    and skill-based matchmaking system that ensures you'll <br>be
                    matched with the right players each game.
                    <h2>Our Review <button onclick="seemoreFun()" id="moreBtn">v</button></h2>
                    <div id="seemore" style="display: none;">
                        There’s an adage that the Dota 2 community often quotes when
                        someone identifies themselves as a new player. “Welcome to Dota 2!” 
                        They say, with open arms, before concluding with, “You suck.” They're not wrong: 
                        for the first dozen hours or so, you'll be bombarded with too much information 
                        and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. But if you 
                        persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer 
                        experiences anywhere in gaming. It's an achievement owed to uncompromising depth,
                        a ridiculously generous free-to-play model, and the great features developer
                        Valve has built up around it.
                        Valve's artists deserve praise for a crisp and readable style that, after some practice, makes it possible to tell what's going on even in a massive brawl where both teams of five colorful fantasy characters collide and cast spells at once. However, credit for the intimidatingly complex design of Dota 2 belongs to the original Defense of the Ancients mod (known as DOTA) for Warcraft III, which kicked off the MOBA genre. Valve (after hiring on DOTA's key developers) has copied that formula almost to the letter, and as a result Dota 2 has become notorious even among its MOBA peers for its difficulty – and that’s totally justified. It’s a double-edged sword that leads to both a terrifying introduction and a world-class competitive game at the highest levels.
                        <br><br>
                        As such, you should not expect to have fun your first day playing... or even your first week. That sounds like a cardinal sin of gaming, but there’s method to this madness. In short, Dota 2 is a deeply layered construct of systems, and to survive you need to understand every single one and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold they’d get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of complex abilities like Bloodseeker’s Rupture (which deals huge damage with every step you take) is a big barrier to entry. Even figuring out which of the 102 heroes (and counting) fits you best is a time-consuming challenge.
                        <br><br>
                        Initially, you’re thrown into the deep end to flounder, trying out any hero that makes the slightest bit of sense. The selection is bewildering: playing as Riki with his permanent invisibility from level 6 on is an obvious choice, as it's hard to kill what you can't see. Drow Ranger, perhaps, with her obscene damage the instant she unlocks her "ultimate" ability at level 6, and her slowing Ice Arrows that enable both escapes and setting up a kill. On the more complex end of the spectrum you have choices like the armour-manipulating Templar Assassin, or the incredibly mobile Storm Spirit, who can dart around the battlefield and avoid damage by simply not being in the wrong place at the wrong time. On top of that there are well over 100 items to choose from within each game, each with their own ways of manipulating and enhancing your stats and suite of active abilities.
                        <br><br>
                        Your learning has just begun when you've settled on what roles, heroes, and builds suit you best – you also have to adapt based on what other players choose. If the other team plays a Riki, you need to compensate with an emphasis on detection. Go up against Bloodseeker and his hideously powerful Rupture will force you to carry around a Town Portal Scroll to get home in a hurry.
                        <br><br>
                        To grasp the subtleties of how heroes interact and fight you have to do more homework on the different kinds of damage and how they’re mitigated; how to prevent one type of spell from affecting you, and when you use that countermeasure; how the different kinds of aggro work, and when you need to manipulate them; the timers (which aren't made visible), and how to optimise your play around them.
                    </div>
                    
                    <h2>TLDR</h2>
                    Dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably won’t suit you if you’re looking to play casually. There’s a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, there’s a wild and exciting variety of play here that’s unmatched, even by its peers. It’s a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that it’s completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isn’t just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. May the best team win.
